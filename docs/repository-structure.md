Frontend feature entrypoints live under `frontend/src/features/`. During the
incremental migration, an entrypoint may re-export a legacy page or API client;
new route consumers import the feature boundary. Backend production consumers
follow the same rule through `northstar_api.modules`. Compatibility paths remain
until worker/task and rolling-deployment contracts can be removed safely.

`frontend/` and `backend/` are the two application roots. There is deliberately
no additional `apps/` wrapper. Likewise, `infrastructure/` and `kubernetes/`
replace the ambiguous legacy roots `infra/`, `deploy/`, and root `services/`.
The CI and release pipelines enforce this contract with
`scripts/validate-architecture.sh` so duplicate or empty umbrella folders cannot
silently return.

## Dependency direction

1. The web application depends only on the public HTTP API contract.
2. API routers depend on domain services and persistence models.
3. Workers reuse domain services but run as separate processes.
4. Application code does not import deployment definitions.
5. Deployment definitions reference immutable application images.
6. Infrastructure scripts contain no application business logic.

## Runtime ownership

| Process | Entry point | Responsibility | Scaling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web | `frontend` | Browser control plane | Horizontal |
| API | `northstar_api.main:app` | HTTP API and coordination | Horizontal |
| Migration | Alembic | PostgreSQL schema | Once per release |
| Celery worker | `workers.celery_app` | RabbitMQ commands | Horizontal |
| Job dispatcher | `workers.job_dispatcher` | Durable jobs to RabbitMQ | Singleton/leader |
| Outbox relay | `workers.outbox_publisher` | Database outbox to Kafka | Singleton/leader |
| Analytics consumer | `workers.analytics_consumer` | Kafka analytics | Consumer group |
| Object cleaner | `workers.object_cleaner` | Kafka cleanup and S3 | Consumer group |

Sharing one backend image preserves identical schemas, encryption, tenant isolation, and provider contracts. Compose and Kubernetes still control each process independently.
